            <h2>Description / How to play</h2>

                <h3>Modes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The game offers single player and multiplayer option. (Multiplayer is playing on the same computer) 
                        Additionally, you can choose from 5, 10 or unlimited points game.
                        <br>
                        There are two modes: Play, Practice.
                        <br>                        
                        For playing against computer, difficulties include: easy, medium, hard, and impossible. 
                        These difficulties also apply to practice, the higher the difficulty, the faster the ball, 
                        and more radically the ball returns from the wall.
                    </p>
                
                <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        Both player are paddles that move with arrow keys and WASD. <br>
                        The objective is to make the other player miss the ball. One miss = one point. <br>
                        Reach the goal and you win.
                    </p>
                
                <h3>Physics / mechanics</h3>
                    <p>
                        The ball initially starts with slow speed, but as the game continues without anyone scoring, the ball speeds up. <br>
                        The direction of ball leaving the paddle is determined from how far away from paddle's center it is hit. <br>
                        So, hit in center and it will go straight. Hit on edge and it goes at an angle(max 55 degree angle). <br>
                        This means more risk = more reward as angled shots are hard to hit.
                    </p>
