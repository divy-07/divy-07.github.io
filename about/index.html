                    A first year engineering student at the University of British Columbia, part of the UBC Thunderbots engineering design team.
                    I am a self-taught programmer passionate about coding in different programming languages.
                    I mostly code in Python and make 
                    <a href="../games" class="links">games</a> using PyGame.
                    I also work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development.
                    Moreover, I also have experience with C, C++, and Java.
                    <br> <br>
                    I love to problem solve and come up with creative solutions.
                    My favourite classes in school are Math and Physics.
                    Other than programming, I love yoga and playing 
                    <a href="https://lichess.org/@/divy_the_chess_guy" target="_blank" class="links">chess</a>.
                    I play cricket and badminton, additionally, I love watching Formula 1.

                    This is a website I made for learning purposes,
                    in fact this is my first web development project.
                    But I also intend to share my PyGame projects here.
