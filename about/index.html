                    I am a High School senior, a self-learner, and a programmer.
                    I am passionate about coding in different programming languages.
                    I mostly code in Python and make 
                    <a href="../games/index.html" class="links">games</a> using PyGame. <!--change for github-->
                    I also work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development.
                    Additionally, I have experience with Java and I have created GUIs with it.
                    <br> <br>
                    I love to problem solve and come up with creative solution.
                    My favourite subjects in school were Math and Physics.
                    Other than programming, I love yoga and playing 
                    <a href="https://lichess.org/@/IND_Divy07" target="_blank" class="links">chess</a>.
                    I play cricket and badminton however I love watching Formula 1.
                    <br> <br>
                    This is a website I made for learning purposes,
                    in fact this is my first web development project.
                    But I also intend to share my PyGame projects here.
